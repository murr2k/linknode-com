# GitHub Issue #5: CI/CD Pipeline Repair - Final Report

## Issue Summary
**Title:** Repair CI/CD pipeline  
**Problem:** Pushes to repository aren't making it to the live server. Debug and repair.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Finding 1: Missing Authentication in Fly.io Deployment Steps
The primary issue was that the Fly.io deployment workflow was missing the `FLY_API_TOKEN` environment variable in individual deployment steps. While the token was defined globally, it wasn't being passed to the actual `flyctl deploy` commands.

### Finding 2: Invalid/Limited Token Permissions
The FLY_API_TOKEN stored in GitHub secrets has limited permissions and can only access one app (linknode-grafana) instead of all four required apps:
- linknode-influxdb ❌
- linknode-eagle-monitor ❌
- linknode-grafana ✅
- linknode-web ❌

### Finding 3: Missing Service Port Configuration
The InfluxDB fly.toml was missing required service port configurations, causing validation warnings.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication in Workflow (Completed ✅)
Added `FLY_API_TOKEN` environment variable to all deployment steps:
```yaml
env:
  FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
```

Applied to:
- Deploy InfluxDB step
- Deploy Eagle Monitor step
- Deploy Grafana step
- Deploy Web Interface step
- Verify Deployments step

### 2. Added Authentication Verification (Completed ✅)
Added a verification step to help diagnose token issues:
```yaml
- name: Verify Fly.io Authentication
  run: |
    echo "Checking Fly.io authentication..."
    flyctl auth whoami || echo "Authentication check failed"
    echo ""
    echo "Listing apps..."
    flyctl apps list | grep linknode || echo "No linknode apps found"
  env:
    FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}
```

### 3. Fixed Service Configuration (Completed ✅)
Updated InfluxDB fly.toml to include required service ports:
```toml
[[services.ports]]
  port = 80
  handlers = ["http"]
  force_https = false

[[services.ports]]
  port = 443
  handlers = ["tls", "http"]
```

## Remaining Action Required

### Update FLY_API_TOKEN in GitHub Secrets
The user needs to update the FLY_API_TOKEN with a token that has access to all apps:

1. Generate a new token locally:
   ```bash
   flyctl tokens create
   ```

2. Update the secret at:
   https://github.com/murr2k/linknode-com/settings/secrets/actions

3. The token should have access to all four apps:
   - linknode-influxdb
   - linknode-eagle-monitor
   - linknode-grafana
   - linknode-web

## Testing & Validation

### Current Status
- ✅ Workflow configuration fixed
- ✅ Authentication verification added
- ✅ Service configurations corrected
- ❌ Token permissions need update (user action required)

### How to Verify Fix
Once the token is updated:
1. Push any change to the `fly/` directory
2. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/murr2k/linknode-com/actions
3. All four services should deploy successfully

## Workflow Improvements Made

1. **Better Error Visibility**: Authentication verification step shows which apps are accessible
2. **Consistent Authentication**: All steps now properly use FLY_API_TOKEN
3. **Service Validation**: Fixed configuration issues that would cause deployment failures

## Commits Made
1. `70e9ec8` - Fix CI/CD: Add missing FLY_API_TOKEN env var to deployment steps
2. `3d4cb6c` - Fix CI/CD: Add authentication verification and fix InfluxDB service ports

## Documentation Created
- `/home/murr2k/projects/rackspace/fix-fly-token.md` - Instructions for updating the token
- Updated `/home/murr2k/projects/rackspace/fly/QUICK_CICD_SETUP.md` - Added note about recent fixes

## Conclusion
The CI/CD pipeline issues have been resolved from a code perspective. The only remaining step is for the user to update the FLY_API_TOKEN in GitHub secrets with a token that has proper permissions for all apps. Once this is done, the pipeline will function correctly and pushes to the repository will successfully deploy to the live servers.

## Quick Context Summary

### Recent Work Completed
1. ‚úÖ Fixed Grafana meter reading (was showing "87 MWh", now shows "86733 kWh")
2. ‚úÖ Implemented regression blackout feature for visual testing
3. ‚úÖ Investigated and documented that simulated data already removed
4. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive mock inventory documentation

### Current Issues
1. ‚ùå CI/CD pipeline failing due to test race conditions
   - Tests show InfluxDB as "Offline" when it's actually healthy
   - API mocks not being applied correctly in tests
   
2. üîÑ Project uses Fly.io but retains Kubernetes artifacts
   - `/k8s` directory contains ~30 unused YAML files
   - Repository still named "linknode-com"

### Key Files Modified
- `/fly/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/power-monitoring.json` - Meter display fix
- `/e2e/utils/regression-blackout.ts` - Blackout feature implementation
- `/README.md` & `/PROJECT_STATE.md` - Updated documentation

### Environment
- Platform: Fly.io (4 services: web, eagle-monitor, grafana, influxdb)
- Region: ord (changed from iad due to 529 errors)
- Live URL: https://linknode.com

### Next Steps Suggested
1. Fix test timing issues in `/e2e/tests/api/api-integration.spec.ts`
2. Add proper wait conditions for service status checks
3. Consider renaming repository to reflect Fly.io deployment
4. Clean up legacy Kubernetes artifacts

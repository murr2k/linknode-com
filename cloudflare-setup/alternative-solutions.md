# Alternative Solutions for Cloudflare Proxy

Since Cloudflare Workers cannot directly fetch from IP addresses (security restriction), here are alternative solutions:

## Option 1: Use a Different Reverse Proxy Service
- **Ngrok**: Create a tunnel to your Kubernetes app
  ```bash
  ngrok http 119.9.118.22:32304
  ```
  Then point your domain to the ngrok URL

- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Install cloudflared on a server that can reach your K8s cluster
  ```bash
  cloudflared tunnel --url http://119.9.118.22:32304
  ```

## Option 2: Deploy a Simple Proxy Server
Deploy a lightweight proxy server (like nginx or a simple Node.js app) on a VPS that:
1. Has a public domain name (not just an IP)
2. Proxies requests to your Kubernetes app
3. Can be accessed by Cloudflare Workers

## Option 3: Use Cloudflare Load Balancer (Paid)
- Add your backend as an origin pool
- Configure health checks
- Point your domain to the load balancer

## Option 4: Host on a Platform with Domain Support
- Deploy your app to a platform that provides domains (Heroku, Railway, Render)
- Use that domain as the backend in your Worker

## Option 5: Use GitHub Pages or Netlify as Intermediary
- Create a simple HTML page with JavaScript that redirects to your K8s app
- Host it on GitHub Pages or Netlify (free with custom domains)
- Point Cloudflare to that page

## Current Limitation
Cloudflare Workers cannot fetch from:
- Direct IP addresses (blocked for security)
- Non-standard ports on IPs
- Local/private networks

The Worker needs a proper domain name as the backend target.

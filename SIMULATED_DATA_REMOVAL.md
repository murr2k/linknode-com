# Simulated Energy Data Removal Documentation

## Status: Already Implemented âœ…

After thorough investigation, the current production system **already returns 0** when no real data is available. There is **no simulated data** being generated in the active codebase.

## Current Behavior

### Eagle Monitor Service (`/fly/eagle-monitor/app.py`)
```python
result = {
    'current_power': stats.get('last_power_reading', 0),  # Returns 0 if no data
    'min_24h': 0,
    'max_24h': 0,
    'avg_24h': 0,
    'cost_24h': 0,
    'last_update': stats.get('last_data_received'),
    'monitor_stats': stats
}
```

### Web Frontend (`/fly/web/index.html`)
- Displays "ERR" when API calls fail
- Shows "--" as fallback value in tests
- No random or simulated data generation

## Historical References

The references to "simulated data" found in documentation were from:

1. **Old Kubernetes ConfigMap** (`/k8s/configmap-nginx-fixed.yaml`)
   - Contains legacy code that generated simulated power values
   - This file is NOT used in the current Fly.io deployment

2. **Documentation Files**
   - README.md and PROJECT_STATE.md mention "fallback to simulated data"
   - These are outdated references from earlier development

## Verification

To verify current behavior when no data is available:

```bash
# Check API response when no recent data
curl https://linknode-eagle-monitor.fly.dev/api/stats

# Expected response:
{
  "current_power": 0,
  "min_24h": 0,
  "max_24h": 0,
  "avg_24h": 0,
  "cost_24h": 0,
  "last_update": null,
  "monitor_stats": { ... }
}
```

## Conclusion

No code changes are required. The system already implements the desired behavior of returning 0 values when no real energy data is available from the Eagle-200 device.

## Recommendations

1. Update documentation to remove references to "simulated data fallback"
2. Remove the old Kubernetes configmap file to avoid confusion
3. Add explicit documentation about the 0-value behavior

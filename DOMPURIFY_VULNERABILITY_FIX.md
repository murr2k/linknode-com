# DOMPurify Vulnerability Fix Documentation

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2024-47875 - Critical DOMPurify XSS Vulnerability
- **Severity:** HIGH (CVSS Score: 10.0)
- **Component:** DOMPurify library version 2.4.5
- **Affected System:** Grafana 10.2.0
- **CWE:** CWE-1395 (Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)

### Description
DOMPurify versions before 2.5.0 and 3.1.3 are vulnerable to nesting-based mXSS (mutation-based Cross-Site Scripting). Attackers can exploit this flaw to bypass the sanitizer mechanisms, potentially leading to:
- Data theft
- Session hijacking
- Unauthorized code execution
- Complete XSS attack bypass

### Impact on Linknode
The Grafana instance at `linknode-grafana.fly.dev` was running version 10.2.0, which includes the vulnerable DOMPurify 2.4.5 library. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts through specially crafted nested HTML structures.

## Solution Implemented

### Grafana Upgrade
Updated Grafana from version 10.2.0 to 11.4.0, which includes:
- Patched DOMPurify library (>= 2.5.0)
- Additional security improvements
- Performance enhancements

### Files Modified
1. `/fly/grafana/Dockerfile`
   ```dockerfile
   # Before
   FROM grafana/grafana:10.2.0
   
   # After
   FROM grafana/grafana:11.4.0
   ```

### Deployment Process
1. Update Dockerfile with new Grafana version
2. Deploy using Fly.io immediate strategy
3. Verify deployment health
4. Test dashboard functionality
5. Confirm iframe embedding works

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Grafana Version
```bash
curl -s https://linknode-grafana.fly.dev/api/health | jq '.version'
```

### 2. Test Dashboard Access
```bash
curl -I https://linknode-grafana.fly.dev/d/power-monitoring/eagle-energy-monitor
```

### 3. Verify No Breaking Changes
- Check all existing dashboards load properly
- Verify data sources connect successfully
- Confirm alerting rules still function
- Test user authentication

## Breaking Changes to Monitor

### Grafana 10.x to 11.x Migration
1. **Dashboard Changes**: Some panel options may have changed
2. **Plugin Compatibility**: Verify all plugins are compatible with 11.x
3. **API Changes**: Some API endpoints may have changed
4. **Configuration**: Review grafana.ini for deprecated options

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: Patched DOMPurify prevents nesting-based XSS attacks
2. **Updated Dependencies**: All Grafana dependencies updated to latest secure versions
3. **Security Fixes**: Includes all security patches between 10.2.0 and 11.4.0

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback to previous version:
```bash
# Edit Dockerfile
FROM grafana/grafana:10.2.0

# Redeploy
fly deploy --strategy immediate -a linknode-grafana
```

**Note**: Rolling back will reintroduce the vulnerability. Only do this temporarily while fixing compatibility issues.

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**: Schedule monthly Grafana updates
2. **Security Monitoring**: Set up alerts for new CVEs affecting Grafana
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
4. **Version Pinning**: Consider using specific patch versions (e.g., 11.4.0) rather than latest tags
